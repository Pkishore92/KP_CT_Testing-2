## Step 4: Set Up Automatic Building (7 minutes)

Your project needs to be "built" (converted from code to a website). Let's set up automatic building:

### 4.1 Create GitHub Actions Workflow
- Click the **"Actions"** tab in your repository
- Click **"New workflow"**
- Click **"set up a workflow yourself"**

### 4.2 Add Build Configuration
Replace the default content with this workflow file:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
        with:
          bun-version: latest
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install
        
      - name: Build
        run: bun run build
        
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
        
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### 4.3 Save the Workflow
- **File name:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Click **"Commit changes"**
- This creates the automatic build system

---

## Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages (2 minutes)

### 5.1 Go to Pages Settings
- Click **"Settings"** tab in your repository
- Scroll down and click **"Pages"** in the left sidebar

- Leave everything else as default
- Click **"Save"**

### 5.3 Trigger First Build
- Go back to **"Actions"** tab
- Click **"Run workflow"** ‚Üí **"Run workflow"** (green button)
- Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete

---

## Step 6: Access Your Live Website (1 minute)

### 6.1 Get Your URL
After the build completes (green checkmark in Actions):
- Go to **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Pages"**
- Your website URL will be displayed at the top
- Format: `https://yourusername.github.io/project-dashboard`

### 6.2 Test Your Site
- Click the URL to open your live dashboard
- Test the map view and grid view
- Try searching and filtering projects
- üéâ **Your dashboard is now live!**

## Step 7: Update Your Project Data (Ongoing)

### 7.1 Edit Project Data
- In your repository, navigate to `src/data/projects.json`
- Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ‚ùå "Build Failed" Error

### Team Workflow
1. **Project Manager** updates `projects.json` with new data
2. **Automatic build** triggers and updates the website
3. **Team members** access the live URL for latest info
4. **Version history** tracks all changes
