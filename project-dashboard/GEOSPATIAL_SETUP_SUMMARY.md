## 🎯 Two Deployment Paths

### Path A: Use Sample Data (Quick Start - 15 minutes)
1. **Follow the GitHub setup guide** as-is
2. **Replace `projects.json` with `projects_with_geospatial.json`**
3. **Deploy immediately** with sample geospatial data
4. **Show stakeholders** the capabilities
5. **Replace with real data later**

### Path B: Use Your Real Data (Complete Setup - 2 hours)
1. **Convert your polygon/point data** to GeoJSON format
2. **Follow the complete data migration guide**
3. **Upload your actual geospatial files**
4. **Update project metadata** with real information
5. **Deploy production-ready dashboard**
